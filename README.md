## Go-Render is a high-performance 3D object renderer written entirely in Go. This project aims to:

- Load and parse 3D OBJ files.
- Apply textures to 3D models.
- Render scenes efficiently using Go's concurrency and performance capabilities.

## Features

- **Pure Go implementation:** No external rendering libraries required.
- **OBJ file support:** Load 3D models from standard .obj files.
- **Texturing:** Apply custom textures to models.
- **Concurrency:** Utilize Go's goroutines for efficient rendering.

## If you'd like to build and run it

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndrewBlackwell/go-render.git
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   go run ./cmd
   ```
# Important Notice:
### This project was originally built as a chance to learn Golang and to create something cool in the process. Personally, I achieved what I set out to do. However, it’s important to note that the project is incomplete. Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, or even fork it, but please don’t expect it to work as intended or for me to come back and finish it.
