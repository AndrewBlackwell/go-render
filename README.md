## Go-Render is a high-performance 3D object renderer written entirely in Go. This project aims to:

- Load and parse 3D OBJ files.
- Apply textures to 3D models.
- Render scenes efficiently using Go's concurrency and performance capabilities.

## Features

- **Pure Go implementation:** No external rendering libraries required.
- **OBJ file support:** Load 3D models from standard .obj files.
- **Texturing:** Apply custom textures to models.
- **Concurrency:** Utilize Go's goroutines for efficient rendering.
